This guide provides a list of common errors and steps to resolve them when installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

The installation can be resumed where it stopped by running the init script:

*AWS and Manual installations*:
----
/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/init.sh 
----

*Azure installations*:
----
/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/script.sh 
----


== All Nodes

The following steps are performed on all nodes.

=== Step: Detect Properties

This step detects the variables which the installation process needs to carry out its procedures. The methods for providing these variables to the installation vary based upon where the installation is running.

* For AWS, the variables are set in the terraform script, and outputted to a file located in `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/env`.
* For Azure, the variaables are set when running the ARM template, and are retrieved as tags on the Virtual Machine instances.
* For manual installations, the user creates a file with the values located in `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/env`.

After these properites are retrieved, a procedure will run to connect to Anypoint Platform and retrieve additional values based upon the `RTF_ACTIVATION_DATA` value.

==== Common errors

The following error may occur if there is an issue with the activation data value, or if there is trouble reaching the internet on the instance:

----
curl: (7) Failed connect to anypoint.mulesoft.com:443; Operation now in progress
Error: Failed to fetch registration properties. (000). Please check your token is valid


============ Error ============
Exit code: 1
Line:
----

If this error is observed, try the following:

* Ensure your instance has outbound internet connectivity. A simple way to validate is to run the following command and verify a 301 response is returned:
+
----
curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
+
* Re-try running the installation procedure, in case the network connectivity was not finished initalizing.
** On Azure, the script should be located at `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/script.sh foreground`
** On AWS and manual installatons, the script should be located at `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/init.sh foreground`
* Validate the activation data value is correct by comparing with the Runtime Fabric created in Anypoint Runtime Manager.

If you are still encountering issues, please file a support ticket for further assistance.

=== Step: Install Packages

This step will install required packages on the instance. It uses the `yum` package repository to download and install the required packages.

==== Common errors

If there is a failure on this step, verify the following:

* Ensure your instance has outbound internet connectivity. A simple way to validate is to run the following command and verify a 301 response is returned:
+
----
curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
+
* If running a manual installation, ensure the `init.sh` script is run with root privledges:
+
----
sudo ./init.sh foreground
----
+
* Manually install one of the required packages to determine if it is successful outside of the installation script:
+
----
sudo yum install -y chrony
----
+
** If not successful, please work with your operations team for assistance. You may need to ask for elevated access to the instance.

If manual installation of a package was successful, or if you still require assitance, please file a support ticket.

=== Step: Format and Mount Disks

This step performs the following tasks on the block devices or disks provided with the `RTF_DOCKER_DEVICE` and/or `RTF_ETCD_DEVICE` variables:

. Performs a check to confirm the values map to block devices available on the instance.
. Unmounts the disks in case they were previously mounted.
. Formats the disks.
. Adds an mount entry in the `/etc/fstab` file.
. Creates directories based upon the values in `$DOCKER_MOUNT` and/or `$ETCD_MOUNT`.
. Mounts the disks to the expected directories created above.

==== Common errors

If the values provided with the `RTF_DOCKER_DEVICE` and/or `RTF_ETCD_DEVICE` variables did not match with block devices on the instance, the following error may be outputted:

----
----

If this error occurs:

* 


=== Step: Configure iptables Rules

=== Step: Configure Kernel Modules

=== Step: Start System Services

=== Step: Configure dockerd Proxy

== Controller VM Starting the Installation

The following steps are performed on the node used to start the installation.

=== Step: Fetch Installation Package

=== Step: Create Cluster

=== Step: Install RTF Components

=== Step: Install Mule License

=== Step: Generate Ops Center Credentials

== Joining Nodes

The following steps are performed on the nodes which join the controller VM used to start installation.

=== Step: Join Cluster

==== Remediation Steps:
 * Verify outbound TCP port 5672 is open to the Internet. Connections should be allowed from the controller VM(s) running in your internal network to this hostname on the Internet: 
 * A TCP proxy may be needed to establish a connection to the Internet. Check with your network team to verify and configure if needed. The xref:install-port-reqs.adoc[Network and Ports Requirements] page should provide the information required.
